    "# Combine agents and vector stores\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers how to combine agents and vector stores. The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vector store and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

However, it does not implement all the \"opinionated\" lint rules from flake8-bugbear or support custom lint rules like Flake8 does. Ruff's primary advantage lies in its performance and being a Rust-based alternative that can minimize conflicts across plugins by using different rule codes and allowing easy toggling of plugin rules. Additionally, it offers compatibility with Black for formatting, though the line-length enforcement might differ slightly. If you are migrating from Black to Ruff, most of your code should remain unchanged, but some minor differences may be observed when running on non-Black-formatted code or dealing with end-of-line comments.\u001b[0m\n",
